# SQL_Tableau_Project_01
Here I am using Self contained database file "db_dump_version_2-2.sql" in MySQL,where i have cleaned the data using queries

Further i have used tableau where i first developed connection between Tableau Desktop and MySQL and then drew a Star schema where 
Transactions(table 1 out of 5) served as Fact table and other four tables became Dimension table.

Based on relations between the tables i drew some conclusions and their visualizations were created on tableau Desktop.

Finally from my database i created the Revenue details of hardware sold all over India and published my dashboard on 
tableau public 

The link for my dashboard Book1 can be seen at
